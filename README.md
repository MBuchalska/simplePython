Some simple programs in Python that I wrote for practice. Please find the description of the programs below.

1. diceRoll - rolls a dice of your choice, by generating random number form the range you want.
1.1. input all the numbers one by one
1.2. input a roll in D&D notation like 4d4+5
1.3. random roll of D&D dice
1.4. Fireball - roll 8d6 and gives an answer depending on the result.

2. Guess the number game. Generates a random number 1-1000. The player has to guess the number.

3. passwordGenerator - generates random string of lower and uppercase letters with the length of your choice.

4. checkPESEL - checks if the PESEL (Polish ID number) number is valid. If the number is valid it calculates your birth day and checks the assigned gender
